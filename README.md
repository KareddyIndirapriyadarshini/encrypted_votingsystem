# üîê Secure Voting System Using RSA Encryption

This is a secure client-server voting system built in Python. It allows users to register with a 10-digit ID, receive a unique token, and securely cast a vote using RSA encryption. The server decrypts the vote, stores it in a local database, and plots the final results as a bar chart.

## üöÄ Features

- RSA-based encryption and decryption for vote privacy
- Token-based voter authentication
- Prevents double voting
- Multithreaded server to handle multiple clients
- IP address and timestamp logged with each vote
- Visual vote tally using `matplotlib`
- SQLite database for persistent storage

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Highlight

> üîê **Note:**  
> This project includes code to programmatically generate RSA keys using Python. However, in real-world scenarios, it's highly recommended to use keys generated by **trusted cryptographic libraries** such as OpenSSL or `cryptography.hazmat`.  
> This ensures that key generation follows industry standards with strong randomness, secure storage, and reliable entropy. This project does use Python's `cryptography` library to ensure safe key handling.

## üñ•Ô∏è How to Run This Project on Your Machine

### üìã Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.7+ and the required libraries installed:

```bash
pip install cryptography matplotlib
```
step1 : intialize the data base
```bash
python3 init_db.py
```
step2 : start the server
```bash
python3 server.py
```
you'll see the public key printed in the terminal
copy this public key - you'll need to paste it on the client side while voting

step3 : open the client.py and update this line with your server's IP and Run the client

```bash
host = "xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx" #change this to your server's IP
```
```bash
python3 client.py
```
